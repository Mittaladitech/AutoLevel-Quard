# AutoLevel-Quard
AutoLevel Quard is a flying drone designed for stable flight in Air.

## Introduction
A quadcopter is an assistive device which has a high demand in
the industrial & surveillance sector. As technology has
matured and become more mainstream, some practical
and very interesting uses of Quadcopter technology have
emerged. The present work includes the design and
development of Quadcopter using ATMEGA328.

## Hardware description
The quadcopter use an Arduino microcontroller Atmel328 as
the core controller and is designed and developed to achieve 
the real-time operating system. This system uses one receiver
attached on a controller board and a transmitter that controls
the motion of a quadcopter. The hardware consists of simple
Arduino board with an Atmega 328, propellers, ESCs & flight
controller board (FCB), transmitter & receiver and gyroscope
for a stable flight.

Hardware is programmed in Embedded C++ language. The controller board
and ESC’s work together. FCB gives the command to ESCs
which is further connected to BLDC motors for the rotation.

## Algorithm
The microcontroller ATMEGA328 is programmed using Embedded C++
language with Arduino IDE software. It’s a development
environment that simply uses an user interface for adding and
editing in the arduino coding language. These programs are
utilized in various calibration steps which include.
- Stage1:- Step1_Al_setup
- Stage2:- Step2_esc_calibrate
- Stage3:- Step3_Flight_controller
